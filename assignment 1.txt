HTTP 1
------
1)For every TCP connection there is only one request and one response.
2)Headers are sent on every request leading to a lot of duplicate data being sent uncompressed across the wire.
3)Text based protocol that is in the readable form.
4)Provides support for caching to deliver pages faster.

HTTP 2
------
1)Uses multiplexing, where over a single TCP connection resources to be delivered are interleaved and arrive at the client almost at the same time.
2)Header compression is included by default in HTTP/2 using HPACK.
3)It is a binary protocol.Needs to be converted back from binary in order to read it.
4)Removes the need for unnecessary optimization hacks.

You enter a URL into a web browser
The browser looks up the IP address for the domain name via DNS
The browser sends a HTTP request to the server
The server sends back a HTTP response
The browser begins rendering the HTML
The browser sends requests for additional objects embedded in HTML (images, css, JavaScript) and repeats steps 3-5.
Once the page is loaded, the browser sends further async requests as needed.
